# Kepler Exoplanet Search Results

This repository explores exoplanet candidates observed by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope using machine learning techniques to identify, classify and analyse potential exoplanets. The project aims to build a reproducible pipeline for preprocessing light curve data, training models and evaluating their performance.
